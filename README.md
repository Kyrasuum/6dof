# planetview
Game mode for Garry's Mod that allows spherical physics.

Gravity is simulated using real life formulas and players 
are able to walk the surface of spherical objects defined
by the map.

Goals may also include modifications to the drag and friction
system in Garry's mod to better reflect real life physics.
