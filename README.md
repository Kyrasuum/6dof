# planetview
A child of spacebuild gamemode for Garry's Mod.

Gravity is simulated using real life formulas and players are able to walk the surface of spherical objects defined by the map.
The idea from spacebuild is to be able to play and create your ship from the planetary surface then take that ship into space to battle and explore in space.
We are taking this one step further by allowing the player to feel immersed regardless if they are on the planet or venturing into the dangerious unknowns of space.

## Goals include:
* The ability to walk on spherical planets
* The ability to go on spacewalks
* Realistic gravity that allows orbiting planets
* Modifications to the drag and friction system in Garry's mod to better reflect real life physics.
* Its own custom life support system built for ease of use
* A wide range of environmental conditions for planets
* Sounds only being heard clearly in atmosphere or somewhat so while touching the source of the sound
* Various server requisites and spacebuild features
* Possibly looking into ways to 'enlarge' the map
