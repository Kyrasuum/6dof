# 6 Degrees of Freedom (6DOF)
6DOF attempts to implement the ability to fully rotate the player in Garry's Mod.
This is for the explicit purpose of utilizing spherical maps.
Therefore this project includes space exploring themes as adjacent goals.

Partially inspired by gamemodes like Spacebuild.


## Running:
Simply download and place the '6dof' folder in your 'GarrysMod/garrysmod/addons' folder.
The addon should now be running.
I recommend playing this on maps intended for 6dof as otherwise results can be unexpected.


## Goals include:
-- Provide a seemless experience walking on surface of spherical planets\
-- Provide ability for players to control their rotation in zero g environments\
-- Simulate gravity due to spherical bodies\
